It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that nearly all deals can be solved. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\n\nRules\n\nConstruction and layout:\n\n* One standard 52-card deck is used.\n* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\n* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\n\nBuilding during play:\n\n* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\n* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\n* Foundations are built up by suit.\n\nMoves:\n\n* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\n\nVictory:\n\n* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\n\nFor games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.\n\nSupported Operations:\n* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;\n* Double Tap on the column's last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;\n* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;\n* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;\n* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;\n\nWith Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!\nEnjoy it, players!",

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n \nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. \n \nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.",

Eleven years later, two days before her fourteenth birthday, Ashley receives a package from her father containing a birthday card and a device called a DAS. The DAS, programmed to respond only to Ashley's biometrics, contains a message from her father, claiming that he is waiting for her on Blood Edward Island. \nAssuming control of Ashley Robbins, players navigate through 3D environments and attempt to solve puzzles. During movement, the touchscreen displays an aerial view of Ashley and her surroundings. The player can move Ashley using a point and click system, dragging the stylus across the screen, or using the D-pad. The top screen shows pre-rendered images of the player's current location. To solve puzzles encountered in the game, the player must use the touchscreen, or other DS capabilities, such as the DS microphone.",

The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. \n \nThe action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.",

The game combines platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat elements into its gameplay, and consists of six levels. \n \nThe game's platforming sections, have been compared to those of the Tomb Raider series, and allow the player to perform several acrobatic manoeuvres, such as jumping or shimmying along edges. The player must also evade dangers and traps such as rotating saws or falling debris. \n \nDuring combat, the game allows the player to switch between gun combat and hand-to-hand combat. The player has a range of melee attacks that can be used against enemies, and can also evade the attacks of enemies. Gun combat features a lock-on system, and the player can use either pistols, shotguns or tommy guns. The game also includes puzzle-solving, in the form of hieroglyphic decoding.Additional unlockables, such as concept art, can be obtained by collecting artifacts hidden throughout the levels.",

Each player is in a hurry to be like the first and get rid of all their cards. At the same time from level to level the reaction rate of rivals increases and it will be harder for you to win. \nAs in any other game, much depends on your luck. Perhaps the sequence of cards will be perfect and you will have time to get rid of them in the very first seconds of the round. But in more difficult conditions, the game can be very long. In this case, you will need a strong concentration, perseverance and thirst for victory. \nGood luck and enjoy the game!",

The game was intended to be a promotional tie with Wimpy restaurants as their logos, company mascots, and theme tunes were reproduced. The game was released on the Oric 1, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Commodore 64. The gameplay is similar to the video game BurgerTime.[1] \n \nGameplay[edit] \nAt the start of the game, Mr. Wimpy has to cross his kitchen while avoiding moving manholes to get to the larder so that he can collect ingredients and make his burgers. As an added hazard, a character called Waldo tries and steal these ingredients from him.[2] After the opening level, the game becomes a traditional platform game where the player must guide Mr. Wimpy across the platforms while walking over four various burger ingredients, which in turn causes them to crash to the platform below and finally to the four plates at the bottom.[2] Mr. Wimpy must also avoid various enemies in the guise of walking sausages, eggs, pickles, and spoons. Players have the ability to spray pepper at the enemies, which temporarily freezes them for a few seconds, allowing players to escape.[2] Enemies can also be trapped and squashed by walking over burger ingredients while they are on the level below.[3] \n \nThe platform portion of the game features the following enemies: Sid Sos (a walking sausage), Ogy Egg (a walking fried egg), Sam Spoon (a walking spoon), and Pam Pickle (a walking pickle).[3] As the player progresses in the game, more enemies are added.[citation needed] Mr. Wimpy's only defences against the enemies are to either trap them between the falling burger ingredients or to temporarily freeze them with pepper.[citation needed] However, players can only a small supply of pepper at any given time (4 bottles could be carried).[2] Players can pick up coffee cups or ice creams that appear on the screen (when they are down to their last pepper pot), rewarding them with an extra pepper pot.[2] Players are given four lives at the start of the game, any of which can be lost in the opening Larder level by falling down a moving pothole or by getting caught by an enemy in the platform portion of the game.[citation needed]",

All the aspects of the Championship have been faithfully reproduced in each aspect of the game: the menu graphics and the TV cameras, the pit, the paddock show, the starting grid and the fascinating \"umbrella girls\" will contribute to make the gaming experience as involving as possible. \n \nThanks to a series of options it's possible to make the game more faithful to the real thing or easier and more accessible, based on one's preferences. After selecting the preferred riding style between Basic, Arcade, Advanced, Simulation and Extreme, it's possible to adapt the game to each own needs: braking assistance, power braking, front and rear braking at once or separate control, traction control, advanced physics, off track stability control, rider's health, bike damages, tire wear, starting help, automatic transmission, rider position control, official rules, warm up lap, false start penalty, ideal trajectory, riding help. \n \nWhen selecting the Simulation riding model there are many things that need to be taken into consideration: tires wear down, brakes can wear down, the bike can be damaged and the rider can be injured when an accident occurs. It's therefore important to find the best setup for the bike changing suspension setup, handling geometry, braking, chainring length, gear ratio and tire type.",

Acclaim's Mountain View, California-based coin-op division went out of business shortly after creating the game, so it never went into full production. GamePro reported that Armageddon was shown to their editors behind the scenes at the 1997 ASI show in Las Vegas, but did not appear on the show floor.The arcade board used 3dfx components and included 600 MB of RAM. \n \nGameplay is a cross between real time combat and strategy, with characters representing one of the five colors. White had healing and soldiers; Blue countermagic and water creatures; Black death and undead creatures; Red fire and mountain creatures; and Green elves and forest magic. The game was controlled with a trackball, and supported up to two players. Players could summon creatures to the arena as well as attack the opposing wizard directly",

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson \"Skeeter\" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. \nYou and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles . . . through six stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous land-slides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. \nIf your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double whammy slams. \nIt's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames\u2122. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball bearings into bullets.",

The game features a Practice Mode, Preseason (which is an exhibition game), New Season and a Play Editor, allowing you to create your own offensive plays and save them to memory card (up to 24 plays can be saved for each block of space). \n \nSeason progress can be resumed through passwords or via memory card, which offers you a choice between a regular or advanced memory card season. Regular means you can trade and create players, but the trades will be automatic and the created players always appear on your team. The advanced option lets you play the role of General Manager, including signing free agents (by bidding on them), organizing trade offers (which can be rejected) or creating players to add to the free agency pool.",

Who gets all these splinters becomes the master of Endoria. Now two rival arch mages got aware of this myth and go on the search. You are one of them. \n \nOf course you have to dig deep into the underground to find them. Your responsibility lies in the building. managing and defending of mines. To achieve this you hire employees with different professions: Craftsmen, researchers, mine workers, hauliers and warriors. These people want to see money for their work and they improve their abilities when they become experienced. \n \nDuring the game you dig new alleys, equip them with traps, research new tools and fight against enemy troops to conquer their alleys. Later you have mutated creatures to your disposal. You spend most of your time on a map with hexagonal fields. There you issue orders and set the routes of your employees. \n \nThe in 1995 released CD-ROM version features speech, new background music and an online help. Additionally there is a \"light\" version of the game which tones down the complexity. \n \nThe PC version of Magic Endoria differs from the Commodore 64 version released the previous year in that it is real time instead of turn based.",

For the first time in the franchise, boss battles crash the party and challenge players to compete to defeat a common enemy. In addition, players now travel across stages together in a vehicle towards a common goal - overcoming obstacles, battling bosses, and collecting Mini Stars stolen by Bowser\u2122 and his minions. Featuring 80 new minigames, adventurous new stages, and all-new ways to play that blend cooperative and competitive action for up to four players*, Mario Party 9 is the perfect way to get the party started.\n\n-For the first time in the Mario Party franchise, each stage culminates in a Boss Battle. Collectively, players must combine their strength to defeat classic foes such as Bowser\u2122 and King Boo while still playing competitively to boost their own individual scores.\n\n-In another first for the series, players ride across stages together in special vehicles. Players take turns as Captain of the vehicle by hitting Dice Blocks to move the party forward, hoping to land on lucky spaces. The vehicles also help to streamline game play and keep everyone involved in the action.\n\n-Unique Captain Events on each stage give players a new way to change the shape of the game.\n\n-In Mario Party 9, each themed stage has a clear destination point but with multiple paths along the way, so no two games will play the same. From Toad Road to Boo\u2019s Horror Castle, players will encounter a wide variety of familiar Mario franchise elements in new environments that can be enjoyed solo or with friends.\n\n-Includes 80 outrageous new minigames that find players making pizzas, escaping haunted mansions, and racing snowmobiles.\n\n-No time to play through an entire stage? New minigame modes let players enjoy the action in smaller chunks of time. They can hone their skills at any minigame in Free Play mode or try the Extras mode that includes Goomba Bowling and the puzzle-based Castle Clearout.\n\n-Every time they play, players can earn Party Points that are used to unlock special items and features.\n\n* Additional accessories are required for multiplayer game play and are sold separately.",

Some screens contain a spacecraft that transports the player to another planet. \n \nAmstrad Action gave Into Oblivion an overall rating of 70%, highlighting the large number of screens and the exploration and mapping required to find the safe planet. However, the gameplay was criticized for the lack of excitement from obstacles and enemies.",

It\u2019s a conversion of what most people know as Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and it\u2019s as perfect a conversion as you\u2019re likely to get. This game takes a different pace from the first Wonder Boy game, being more of an adventure with a slower pace and more strategy. You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree - so far so good. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it. Levels are time limited (shown by an egg-timer on the left) so you need to be quick, or energy is taken away from your heart meter.",

Thereafter, making use of the maps, the main military forces are to be dispatched. Despite thorough preparations, the operation fails. Most of the avant-garde helicopters crash. In order to collect information on reasons behind the operation failure, Ukraine's Security Service sends their agent into the Zone center. \n \nFrom now on, everything depends on you.",
