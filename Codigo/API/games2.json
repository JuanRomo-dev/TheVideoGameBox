Unlike the others, which tended to be athletics/exercise games, Meiro Daisakusen (\"Epic Maze Battle\") is a maze-exploring light RPG where the goal is to walk and jump around mazes to find items and, eventually, the exit.\n\nThe game's controls are dictated entirely by the Family Trainer/Power Pad. Different buttons will either cause the protagonist to jump, walk forward, walk backwards, turn left or right or switch their position to the left, right or center of the screen. While searching for the exit, players must be mindful of the various enemies that also inhabit the mazes, most of which must be avoided by jumping over them or running past them.",

Players can enjoy a seemingly endless supply of inventive Mario levels from players around the world. \n \nThe game includes a book totaling about 100 pages that illustrates the boundless possibilities in Super Mario Maker. Nintendo will also release two special Mario amiibo figures to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. game. Tapping these amiibo in Super Mario Maker adds a Big Mushroom power-up to your course, allowing Mario to grow big and bust blocks from any direction, as well as adding a retro visual filter to the game, reminiscent of older cathode ray tube televisions. In addition, many other amiibo will also be compatible with Super Mario Maker through the use of a new item called the Mystery Mushroom. This item allows Mario to take the appearance of many other characters, such as Link, Kirby or Wii Fit Trainer, complete with character-specific animations and sound effects. These character costumes can be unlocked by completing the 100 Mario Challenge mode and many can also be unlocked if the player taps the amiibo of the character to the Wii U GamePad.",

According to the official site, a bug was introduced in the Crosswords game that resulted in the computer only choosing words starting with letters A-T instead of A-Z. The new game added to the mix is Memory Fun - your basic 'Memory' style game where you turn over pairs of tiles to find matches. Another grand edutainment game. No wonder they made so many. ;-)",

        "summary": "The goal in Narrow Escape is to successfully navigate a ship through the narrow, fast-moving passages of the warlord's fortress, destroy the defense forces and avoid space debris. The player's ship must also be maneuvered through small holes in a series of walls where fuel cells can be picked up to restore the ship's constantly decreasing fuel supply. If the player pilots their ship successfully, they will be faced with the warlord's own escape ship which must be hit several times to be destroyed, liberating the star system from the warlord's tyranny. \n \nEach level becomes more difficult as everything will move faster, fuel will be consumed more quickly, the holes in the walls will become smaller, and more menacing defense forces will appear. \n \nEach level of game play consists of two phases: \n \n1. Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed. If the warlord's escape ship is destroyed, the player will enter the next level of play and the game will continue.",

The team was motivated to do a game around this funny monkey. \n \nOn February 02, 1989, the first prototype was ready: one level, no enemies, no musics and the monkey can jump only (no shoot). At this point, they decided to reprogram the game entirely from 0. Note JuJu Densetsu was coded with the same system used by the neogeo coders at SNK. \n \nDuring the first location test (at the TAD office) on September 07, 1989, many new ideas came to the developers but most of them were not included in the final product (i.e: snakes on the first stage), because lack of time. \n \nOn September 15, 1989. a public location test was done in Japan AND in the USA (University of Washington). A second test was done in October. After this test, they decided to program the end of the game (done by a non-programmer in a week-end). Note: The girl you have to save is brune in the attract mode and blonde at the end. \n \nThe game was finished on November 06, 1989. \n \nThen, after about 10 months of development, JuJu Densetsu was finally released on December 08, 1989 in Japan by TAD. 3148 arcade boards were sold. Export releases: \"Toki\". \n \nThe title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of JuJu'. \n \nThe devil monkey with horns from the level 2 is called Bellzador (Dev. code name: Akuma Zaru) and has the most complex AI routine. It takes 27 pages 'A4' format in the source code. Its desing and patern were inspired by Red Arremer from Makaimura. \n \nThere is some unused sprites for the character's animation in the game code. \n \nOn February 26, 1990, TAD know that pirate versions of their game appear on the market. \n \nThis was the last video game developed by TAD. A sequel was planned (JuJu 2! an action puzzle game) for the Super Famicom but the company closed its door 2 months after the JuJu Desnsetsu release. Fortunately, the source code of JuJu 2 was sold to Altron Corp. who released the game as \"Little Magic [Model SHVC-LI]\". \n \nSource: Arcade-History",

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.\n\nIn each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.",

It is the 22nd installment of the NHL series and was released on September 11, 2012 in North America, Europe as well as Australia and New Zealand. The game was released on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, featuring Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux on the cover.[1] The game was featured at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 (E3 2012), which took place between June 5\u20137, 2012. The demo of the game was released on August 21\u201322, 2012, at the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store.[4] \n \nThere was a vote deciding which player would be on the NHL 13 cover. Anybody could vote on the player(s) they wished to see on the cover of the game. The vote started on March 29, 2012 with 60 NHL players in a single-elimination voting with two players in each match-up, and was closed on June 4, receiving over 25 million votes worldwide.[5] On June 20, Claude Giroux was named the winner, over Pekka Rinne at the 2012 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.[6] \n \nAn exclusive \"Stanley Cup Collector's Edition\" was also released, apart from the actual NHL 13 game. The Collector's Edition includes five random Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) player packs from the two 2012 Stanley Cup Finals teams; a Gold Jumbo HUT pack including legend Wayne Gretzky; and a boost pack featuring the CCM RBZ stick.[7] \n \nJust like in NHL 12, Gary Thorne (play-by-play) and Bill Clement (color) provide commentary for NHL 13.[8] \n \nThis year, for the first time, two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero have been added.[9] In NHL 12, users could create female characters, but there were no real-life players.[10] \n \nOn September 20, Gamesindustry.biz reported that NHL 13 had posted the best first week sales in the franchise's history.[11]",

Coupling traditional platformer mechanics with these new interactions, Alkali brings a novel twist on a classical genre.\n\nThe game also contains a fully fledged level editor, where anyone can get creative and make interesting and fun levels for others to play. Using the same tools that were used to create the Alkali's campaign, you can explore fun gimmicks or create difficult masterpieces as you wish.",

        "summary": "Sensible Soccer: European Champions is a fast-paced soccer game. The action is shown from a top-down perspective which only shows a part of the playfield. The controls only use one button to initiate a shot: how long the button is pressed determines the strength and the direction pad controls the direction. However, there is also a novice mode available with the usual division between a shoot and pass button. Another important option is the dribbling (novice or expert) which sets how well the ball sticks to the controlled athlete. Before starting a match, there are also some limited tactical options available (choosing the formation and switching the position of athletes around).\n\nIn contrast to the computer versions there are no pre-set tournaments, but the player can start two tournaments with customizable requirements: cup or league. The cup allows to set the number of rounds (one to four) and some rules can be switched on or off for each round individually (number of legs, extra time, penalties). The league on the other hand has the options number of teams (between one and seven), how often the teams face each other (between once and four times) and if a win rewards two or three points. The pitch type (normal, dry, wet, icy, hard or random) can be set in both modes. There are twenty national and twenty club teams (all with slightly changed original names) to choose from. General options are the game length (between three and seven minutes) as well as switching weather on or off.",

The only evidence against her is the \"mempak\" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a \"stratoglider\" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. \n \nThe first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. \n \nDevelopment \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9's first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. \n \nThe game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. \n \nPete Austin commented on the game: \"It's an alien theme park gone wild. The Eden universe is more like Larry Niven's future space.\" and \"...is intended as a comment on superpower intervention in the Third World.\"",

The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world.

What followed was a blitzkrieg campaign that caught the Austrians completely by surprise. The French army rolled on to the east to take Milan and then turn south and west to fight the Austrian army at Piacenza, Casteggio and then Marengo, the final battle of the campaign. Bonaparte's fame was secure and by 1804 he would be crowned the Emperor of France. \n \nCampaign Marengo covers the battles and campaigns in Northern Italy from 1795 through 1800 and allows the players to refight the famous battles of these campaigns. Three campaign files cover the major campaigns while three shorter ones cover the various operations in 1796 to resupply Mantua and defeat Bonaparte and the French in battle. \n \nRelive the days of Suvorov's Russian army marching onto the fields of battle alongside their Austrian allies. As the commander of the French army in 1796, lead your men on to victory on the fields of Castiglione, Rivoli, Arcole and the other battles around Verona. As Massena, lead the French to victory at Loano in 1795. Campaign Marengo offers all this and more!",

Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns, with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two weapons and switch between them without using up a \"turn,\" allowing them to shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat. \n \nMany engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers. Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made. In addition to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple \"secret maps\" unlocked across the regular levels.",

Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they've found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control. \n \nThis sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There's no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time. If there's something hostile in a new area, you can see his health bar at the bottom. \n \nIn a lot of ways it closely resembles the original Metal Gear, except more sedate and with greater emphasis on NPC dialogue.",

And when it turns out that the island is not completely uninhabited, save the future friend and comrade-in-arms (Friday, who, by the way, has yet to learn Russian) and try to flee by building a balloon out of improvised means and outwitting the pirates. And the fate of the poor fellow Robinson depends on the acumen of the player. Unlike most of the existing adventure games, the main character can influence each of the selected items on any active object on the screen, which makes the passing of the game much more diverse. \"New Robinson\" also includes many ingenious plug-in games.",

Successful power routing of a circuit makes each system slowly come on-line. It takes three powered circuits for minimum function, but four provides more leeway for success.\n\nOn-Line engines and power can be activated for an orbital boost, but too long a burn will damage circuit components. HAL 9000 can power undamaged circuits you assign to him, although at a much slower pace than the player. Communications allow a powered HAL 9000 to inform you of success/failure at powering a circuit assigned to him. Life Support gives more protection against EMPs damaging powered circuits, which require repair and repowering.",

        "summary": "A release not seen in arcades, this Densha de Go! entry focuses on Meitetsu's railroad lines in Nagoya, including the series' only monorail.\n\nYou play as a train engineer which serve the Meitetsu Nagoya line in Japan. There are many kinds of trains that you can drive, from express trains to monorails. Some trains are locked until you finish a mission, for example you can only drive monorails until you've finished the commuter and express train missions. All of the game parts, except the menu and station names, are in Japanese.\n\nIn addition or the Meitetsu Nagoya Line, coverage includes Meitetsu Inuyama Line, Meitetsu Minomachi Line and Meitetsu Monkey Park Monorail Line. This was the first version to feature a monorail, and also featured a Meitetsu hybrid light rail route which ran both on regular train lines and as a sort of urban tram on special lanes in city streets. Part of the gameplay of this required the user to stop for regular traffic signals and avoid car traffic. This was the Densha de Go player's first opportunity to drive a vehicle much lighter (and thus shorter stopping distance) than standard trains.\n\nIn this version, the driver must sound the horn before beginning to accelerate out of a station. This is unique to this title. The gameplay, physics, and strictness of this version were all somewhat relaxed compared to previous versions.\n\nThe game was published by Taito for the Sony PlayStation in Japan on January 27, 2000. It was later ported to the PC by Unbalance on December 1, 2000. The PS1 version later received a re-release as part of D3Publisher's Simple 1500 series of budget games, as Simple 1500 Series Vol. 102: The Densha Utenshi - Densha de Go! Nagoyatetsudou-hen, on August 29, 2002.",

The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.",

Unfortunately he is not very enthusiastic, flees into the water and jams himself under a ship. Myrtle's first priority is to save Gordon. \n \nThe player navigates Myrtle through an underwater labyrinth (although there a few screens above ground) and collects items. Those items have to be used in another location to proceed. It is also important to avoid enemies because touching them reduces her life energy, which can be refilled by finding beer bottles. There is no scrolling and Gordon's air supply acts as time limit.",

It is the second proper game in Hudson's Momotarou Densetsu series - which would later spawn the Momotarou Dentetsu series of railroad virtual board games - and features numerous other figures from Japanese mythology.\n\nThe general structure of the game has Momotarou cross the world with his animal NPC companions, solving the problems of each new town or village he comes across. Upon successfully resolving their demon problem, the town thanks him with elaborate celebrations. Momotarou can eventually pick up a large number of allies, who all follow behind him on the world map. Rather than force the player to locate each new location, they can send their animal companions to scout ahead to eliminate the amount of wandering around.",

Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance. The game is played with a set of 144 tiles based on Chinese characters and symbols, although some regional variations use a different number of tiles. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four groups (melds) and a pair (head). There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, stolen from another player and thus melded, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and honours (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds, and the order of dealing and play. However there are many regional variations in the rules; in addition, the scoring system and the minimum hand necessary to win varies significantly based on the local rules being used. This game is the digital rendition of Mahjong.",

Not on that planet, at least. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing. That was always the nature of humankind. \n \nThe humans were lucky. They had a savior. A company called 'Guardians' emerged with enough resources to help evacuate most of the population of Earth. They were heroes. A group of the highest military rank joined the Guardian, and formed the 'military council', to supervise all human activities of outer space. \n \nBut humankind had much to learn. \n \nThe first curse was radiation. While humanity was sitting comfortably on Earth, waiting to be saved, they could not even imagine that most of outer space is lethal to human life. They can't survive certain radiation types, and in the end, they did not dare to explore. They did not go anywhere. They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the 'Pirate horde', and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions 'The Shattering'. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing.

You'll need to set up defensive patrols to secure the safety of your key sites as well as offensive missions to take out the enemy's strike capability!\n\nThe Battle of Britain early, in World War II was the first large-scale air war. Continental Europe had fallen to the Nazi Blitzkrieg attacks, and Britain alone remained free and fighting. Without the years of preparation the Germans had, the Royal Air Force had many fewer planes than the Luftwaffe; the outlook was bleak. But with heroic bravery and careful planning, the Spitfires and Hurricanes managed to stave off German bombers for long enough for Britain to survive, and America to join in the fight against tyranny.\n\nNow you can recreate this and many other scenarios.

The three radars are to track either aircraft, ships or submarines and these are represented by a white dot when they are within range. \n \nThe map screen has two maps, one a map of the whole area and the other one showing a closer look at your location. On this screen you can control the speed of your ship and steer it with black dots showing the enemy forces. The status screen shows a profile of your ship and any damage is shown as red and if the whole ship is red then it is damaged and the game is over. \n \nWhen an attack is imminent then a gauge besides one of the mini-game icons turns yellow before turning red and that game can be played. If an aircraft is attacking then the game has you controlling a gun to shoot down the planes viewed from a 1st person perspective. You can move the gun left or right and move it up or down to hit the planes before they drop bombs on your ship. This screen is also used for any missile attack. \n \nIf any convoy's of ships are attacking then you must fire a missile at the convoy by first lining up a sight that keeps moving while a timer counts down. When the time reaches zero and the sight is red then it will hit a ship but if it doesn't turn red then you have missed. \n \nThe final game is when a submarine is attacking and the game switches to a 3D side view showing above and below the water. You control a helicopter above the water while the submarine is below. You can move the helicopter left or right, and in and out of the screen. A cursor of the left of the screen moves up and down and when fire is pressed this drops a depth charge which also stops the cursor and this shows the depth your depth charge will explode.",

Due to its rarity (the back insert states the print run was of 2,500 copies), the game has become a prized collector item.\n\nThe actual game consists of a few select levels from Donkey Kong Country with the addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the goal being to score as many points as possible. The tree house and banana cave at the start of Jungle Hijinxs have been disabled and all of the animal tokens in the early levels have been replaced with banana bunches, making it impossible to reach the bonus round without the usage of a cheating device. The player is also given 50 starting extra lives instead of the 5 as in the original game. The game has a time limit of five minutes, which is displayed at the center of the screen.

The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.\n\nA nefarious supervillain named \"Doctor Maybe\" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name \"James Pond\" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like \"License to Bubble\" (after Licence to Kill), \"A View to a Spill\" (after A View to a Kill), \"Leak and Let Die\" (after Live and Let Die) and \"From Three Mile Island with Love\" (after From Russia with Love).",

This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.\nAn English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of \"Pale Dim.\" Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game.

        "summary": "Plot \n \nA hundred years after the arrival of colonists aboard the Snowball 9, planet Eden has become home to half a billion people. In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed \"megapolis,\" and perhaps due to the war that occurred during Return to Eden, there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside. \n \nThe main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim. This \"Garden of Eden as a prison\" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers. \nDevelopment \n \nThe Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It \"evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.\" This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system. It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases. \n \nAnother difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a political thriller that resembles the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Similar to what happened when Snowball was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story is set. The Level 9 Fact Sheet says: \"...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden.\" Another article stated: \"Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III...\" Furthermore, Pete Austin said, \"Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future\" and \"The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place.\" Notice that these sources termed the game by its original name, Worm in Paradise.",

Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. While Project Mirai only had button controls, Project Mirai 2 adds the use of touch screen controls where players tap the bottom screen. An increased sense of speed and additional gimmicks have also been added.\n\nThe \"PuyoPuyo 39\" mini-game can be played by two people through a local wireless connection.",

To find them he has to explore six different parts of the mansion, e.g. the woods, which are basic platform levels: the player moves from left to right while jumping a lot and avoiding enemies. Some of them can be dispatched of by a jump on their heads.\n\nThe main difference to the other versions of this game is a unique level design. There is also a life meter which allows to get hit more often before dying.",

The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos.\n\nThe Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.",

At that time, a new squad called Shinsengumi was formed on the orders of the Military Commissioner Matsudaira Katamori to maintain peace and order. Only women known as \"shouki\", who can harness power of mystical stones known as \"kishouseki\", were eligible to become its members.\n\nOkita Soujirou was working as an instructor at the Shieikan dojo in western Edo. Without any relatives, he considered the dojo master Kondou Isa and her sworn sister Hijikata Sei, who both saved his life when he was young, to be his family. When women of the dojo were called to help in forming the Shinsengumi, they asked Soujirou to disguise himself as a woman and join them. Now known as Okita Soushi, Soujirou held only one goal in him mind - to protect Isa and Sei, even if he couldn't hold the same power as a real \"shouki\".",

        "summary": "Black Jack - Daily 21 points, supports Insurance, \"Straight Flush\" and \"Five Dragon\" inside.\n\nBlackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.[1] Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more decks of 52 cards.\n\nThe player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1-point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a \"hit\" (taking additional cards) to bring their total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called \"busting\"). If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called \"soft\", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; otherwise, the hand is \"hard\".\n\nThe dealer has to take hits until his cards total 17 or more points. (In some casinos, the dealer also hits on a \"soft\" 17, e.g. initial ace and six.) Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. The dealer will lose if he or she busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a \"push\" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money on that hand.\n\nMany rule variations of blackjack exist. Since the 1960's, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards that have been dealt and adapt their wager and playing strategies accordingly.\n\nOther casino games inspired by blackjack include Spanish 21 and pontoon. The recreational British card game of black jack is a shedding-type game and unrelated to the subject of this article.",
