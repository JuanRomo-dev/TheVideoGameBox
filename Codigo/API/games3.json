The gameplay is similar to Space Invaders, which had been released by Taito in 1978.

The aliens are arranged in rows and slowly move to the edge of the screen, before descending and continuing in the opposite direction. As more aliens are defeated, they increase in speed. A UFO will occasionally appear towards the top of the screen, which can be shot down for bonus points. There are three game modes that change the way the aliens move; the first presents two formations of enemies that move in opposite directions, the second continuously adds additional rows of aliens, and the third is functionally identical to Space Invaders.",

Tree branches - You can grow trees to use them as platforms, springboards, rafts and moveable objects. Branches also catch fire.\n3. Vines which work like ropes.

It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fc air\u016b) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne, a fictional sapient cat species that appears in all of the Monster Hunter games. The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game also uses a much more cartoonish art style as opposed to the realism seen in other Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Poka Poka Airou Village G is an expansion pack and was released on August 10, 2011 in Japan. \n \nMonster Hunter Diary Giri Giri Airou Village is a series of ten television shorts developed to help advertise Poka Poka Airou Village. They feature felynes attempting quests and almost invariably failing at them. One episode also has a Chibiterasu cameo. \n \nA Nintendo 3DS version of the game, titled Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village DX was developed and released in Japan on September 10, 2015",

Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.\nFinally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.",

        "release_dates": 853113600,
        "summary": "Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. \n \nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. \n \nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an \u0081eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. \n \nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's \u0081eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. \n \nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing. \n \nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). \n \nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live. \n \nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. \n \nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection.",

The game is a role-playing game based on the works of Japanese author, Kenji Miyazawa, and its release was intended to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of his birth. The game is a sequel to the 1993 Hecht game for the SNES, Ihatovo Monogatari, earlier-broadcast for the Satellaview as well. Intended as a family-oriented game for all ages, the game makes reference to many classic works of Japanese children's literature.\n\nBS Ihatovo Monogatari incorporates voice narration at the start of each weekly broadcast to provide dramatic performances of Miyazawa's poetry set in Ihatovo. During gameplay, the Soundlink provides sound effects and gameplay hints for players. The game's voice actors were selected by popular vote by readers of Seiyu Zasshi and included Kikuko Inoue, Kouichi Yamadera, Yuka Imai, and Eiichi Onoda.",

        "summary": "bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. \n \nGameplay \nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. \n \nOnce you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. \n \nAfter you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen.",

The game combines many classic gameplay ideas in one title, delivering a large amount of variety and keeps the game experience fresh.\n\nThe eleven games are all linked to a central theme - collecting sand dollars to enable you to travel to new islands, buy toys and food for your Tamagotchi-style monkey, and unlock even more games to play.\n\nEach mini game offers the player a different gameplay experience. These are some of them:\n\nPuffer Popper\nWith help from Crab the player must defend the sand castle by destroying bubbles as they snake towards the beach.\n\nA classic and instantly playable concept, Puffer Popper requires the player to connect three bubbles of the same colour to win. Use the left and right joystick or directional pad to aim the beam, and press the action button to fire a bubble.\n\nThe game can be increased in difficulty through the addition of multiple Puffer fish and by potentially removing the players aiming beam.\n\nJungle Jump\nJungle jump is a game of timing and skill. Use the left and right buttons on the joystick or directional pad to guide the Monkey through increasingly difficult jungle levels.\n\nShell Game\nThe shell game is both a game of skill and observation coupled with a way to win more Sand Dollars. Conceptually the Shell Game is extremely simple: three shells that swap, the user must pick the shell that hides the pearl.\n\nDue to the high expense of certain shop items and the cost of purchasing new islands, the user can use the Shell Game to win the Sand Dollars required to make these large purchases.\n\nSandoku\nThe classic favorite Sudoku makes the transition to Tropix effectively, with intuitive play.\n\nCascade\nCascade is a casual concept. The game is a variation on the classic objective of connecting three of a kind. This type of game can be controlled exclusively via the joystick or directional pad with the addition of the action button to make selections.\n\nThe overall design is about linking these mini-games into a \"world\" where you buy things, look after a creature, travel around and explore. For casual gamers, Tropix is simple to play, and can be played in short bites or in long sessions.",

Its gameplay consists of platforming, exploration and weapons-based combat with a main four-button configuration.\n\nPower Factor originally began as a project intended for the Atari ST that was in development by Red Rat Software under the title Red Ace, which was nearly completed before being left unpublished due to internal issues at the company and its eventual disbandment prior to release, however Hand Made Software would later develop a conversion to the Lynx.\n\nPower Factor has been met with positive reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release, who praised various aspects of the title such as the unique storyline, graphics and character animation but many felt divided in regards to the sound design and gameplay. In 2005, a ROM image of the original ST version was leaked online.",

The amount of points earned for each successful guess depends on the selected activity \u2013 describing, drawing, or pantomime. \n \nFor example, describing is the easiest one, so for each successful guess you will get only one point. However, in the case of pantomime you get three points per word. Each round, you can pick which activity to do. You can decide to play it safe and choose to describe all the time, though if your opponents ace the harder activities, they will most likely beat you. \n \nYou can keep up with your current standing by checking team scores depicted as cute progress bars with each team\u2019s color at the bottom of the screen. They show which team is closer to earning fifty points and winning the game. To see who is the reigning Partivity champion among your friends, you can check out the previous games section for the history of all played games along with each game\u2019s winner. If you are up to the task of snatching their champion title, just tap the rematch button and the game is on. \n \nFeatures \nPlay in two to six teams with as many people as you like. \nPause the game just by closing the app and continue whenever you feel like it. \nRecreate teams from previous games to beat the last winner.

When he encounters these enemies as a cub, his roar does little to scare them off. However, maturing into a majestic lion deepens his voice and makes the growl useful as a weapon. As he explores the nine levels, Simba will be able to collect a wide variety of items that will open several bonuses that include puzzles, mini-games, and movies. While the film was animated in 2D, Simba and his world are rendered in three dimensions, and the plot unfolds in cinematic sequences between each level.

        "summary": "O'Leary Manager 2000 is a football player-manager game released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release.\n\nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.\n\nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Den\u00edlson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.\n\nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.\n\nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.",

This game is the first in the Blitz series to receive an \"M\" rating by the ESRB due to the graphic violence, explicit language, and drug use depicted. Lawrence Taylor, who provides voice acting for the game, serves as its official spokesman. In 2006, a second version of the game was released on the Xbox 360 in October. In December 2006, a portable version was released on the PlayStation Portable (under the title Blitz: Overtime). These versions included the voicework and likeness of former pro linebacker Bill Romanowski. The game was originally intended to be a Wii launch title, but the Wii-version was delayed[1] and eventually canceled.[2]\n\nOn January 22, 2007, the game was refused classificatio by the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia, effectively banning the game there. The game was banned as the use of drugs was related to incentives and rewards.",

The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.\n\nThe FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.",

        "summary": "Hello everybody!  \nFlappy Gravity is a game which uses flappy bird's concept but there is a major twist.  \n  \nThere is a line horizontally placed in the centre of the screen called as limit line.  \n  \nIf the bird is above the limit line, gravity will act upwards and the bird will fall upwards.  \n  \nIf the bird is below the limit line, gravity will act downwards and the bird will fall down.  \n  \nThere is a tricky feature : Sticky Jump.  \nIf you tap and hold, there will be a higher jump.  \nIf you tap and release instantly, the jump will be shorter.  \n  \nTap on any portion of the screen to flap (jump) opposite to gravity.  \nBeware of the purple obstacles. The character will die if you touch them.  \n  \nHere is the link to the game : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heethpjain.heeth.flappygravity  \n  \nHope so you like my game!  \nPlease leave an honest rating!  \nI won't ask anyone for fake ratings!  \n  \nAnd suggestions are highly appreciated!",

In fact, the prefight conversation sequences show that the fights are not much more than chance meetings. The player's chosen character will advance through a series of stages fighting a series of opponents because he doesn't like the way the other guy looks.\n\nThe game is viewed from the side perspective that virtually all 2D fighting games use. One player can fight against a computer-controlled opponent, or two players can fight against each other. Each character's life bar appears on the upper left or right of the screen, depending on starting location. A timer is located between the two life bars. When one character is drained of energy or the timer runs out, the match is over and the character left standing (or with more life, if neither characters were drained of energy) wins.",

The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time. The second installment also included more complex scenery and continued the dual-screen interface present in the first.[7] The game starts with the two players parachuting onto an island in search of a buried missile. As they search, players are able to build traps to slow their enemy's progress.[7] This game was going to come out on the NES in North America from Kemco but was scrapped because of poor sales of the first game on NES, but in 2009 reproductions of the game in cartridge form were released in both regular and black and white limited edition cartridges.",

Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead, so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.",

Electronic Arts\u2019 award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series\u2019 history.\n\nIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod\u2019s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI\u2019s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions \u2013 GDI and Nod \u2013 inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world\u2019s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.",

Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown.\n\nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pok\u00e9mon training as a means to make a living.\n\nProfessor Bamb'o, regional expert on Pok\u00e9mon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pok\u00e9mon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region.\n\nThings aren't as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor...

Instead, you use your mouse to draw them into place, while drawing over an already present shape will remove it. It's a very simple mechanic which anyone can easily understand. The story of the game revolves around the evil but slightly incompetent Astroslugs who strife to leave their home planet and conquer the universe.

        "summary": "L.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.\n\nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined.\n\nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the \u201cNicholson Electroplating\u201d Arson case, the \u201cReefer Madness\u201d Vice case, \u201cThe Consul\u2019s Car\u201d Traffic case, \u201cThe Naked City\u201d Vice case and \u201cA Slip of the Tongue\u201d Traffic case.",

You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. \n \nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn't appear to be very original, there's just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.",

When the bars reach the judgement line it is time to scratch. \n \nThe focus of the game is to make the ultimate beatmania version, thus a huge amount of songs was brought back. Because of this the game had to make some sacrifices due to memory limitations. Movies are now displayed in a little box with generic animations from the series playing. Only a few songs have unique clips. The miss animations are missing because of this as well. \n \nDetailed judgement information is now present on the side of play, like the one you could enable in 7thMIX. STEALTH was added as a modifier. \n \nSongs from the entire series except from DREAMS COME TRUE show up. 116 songs were restored from earlier games in the series.

On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it's easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. \n \nApart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it's not always easy to get them! It's also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!",

In each round, the player places a disc that falls from the top of the grid. Each disc has a number 1-7, or a blank. Whenever the number of any disc matches the number of contiguous discs in a row or column, that disc disappears and also hits any blank discs it touches. When a blank is hit twice, it turns into a numbered disc. After a number of turns, the round ends and a full row of blank discs emerges from the bottom of the grid. There is no time limit, and discs may be dropped at the player's leisure. The objective is to eliminate discs and score combos for as long as possible until either the grid overflows or the grid is full and it is impossible to place another disc. If the player clears the screen of all discs, then the player is given a 70,000 point bonus.",

Once finished, the elder departs quickly, lest the beast devour him or her along with its quarry. \n \nThe beast hunts the child sacrifices. \n \nSometimes it glides silently through the air, sometimes it sprints along the ground like an animal. \n \nNo child left to the monster in this way has ever returned to the village. \n \nThis year, you are among those to be sacrificed. \n \nYou don't know if this monster can be hurt, let alone killed. You're sure that if you run far enough and fast enough that you can survive the night without being caught and devoured.",

When the character leaves the end of one, he appears at the start of the next but there are also (on most levels), gaps in the platform where the character can fall through and land on the platform below. There are many hazards scattered across the platforms that must be avoided. These range from static objects like trees and houses to moving objects such as jumping policemen and speeding ambulances. If Dennis hits any of these objects, he is flung from his vehicle as it bursts into flames and he must start again (with 'take 2'). If he crashes too many times, he is 'fired'. Points are given in the form of a wage.",
